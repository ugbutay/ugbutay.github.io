reasons and results of the sugar factory privatizations made in 2018. While
doing this, the changes in the sugar beet production of the provinces were
taken into account. The idea of privatizing sugar factories has existed for
many years. In the letter of intent written by the IMF in 2000, the need for
privatization of sugar factories was clearly stated. and in this letter it is
said that the privatizations should be completed by the end of 2001. However,
at that time, although the government wanted to complete the privatizations,
the judicial decisions stopped these privatizations. In 2018, privatization
trials were carried out for 14 sugar factories and 10 of them were privatized
in the same year. The uncertainty created by the privatization movement in 2018
caused all farmers to stay away from sugar beet production. While the state factories
that continued their activities in 2019 managed to bring their production to
the level of 2017, the privatized factories remained below the
pre-privatization period production level. This can be seen as an indication
that farmers stay away from privatized factories.</span></p>

then sugar factories were also requested to be privatized. In the Stand-By
agreement signed with the IMF in 1999, a new Sugar Law was requested to be
enacted together with the privatizations. The letters of intent (IMF, 2000)
included the privatization of sugar factories. After the agreement with the

pay the Kastomunu sugar factory at the desired levels. The sale of Burdur,

because the companies that bought those factories did not fulfill the

15 sugar factories, 6 sugar factories belong to cooperatives, and 12 sugar
factories as private sugar factories. In addition, there are 5 factories that

Review</span></b></h2>

<p>The privatization of sugar factories is an important issue, but in order to
understand this, it is necessary to examine the effects of sugar factories.
Erdinç (2017) presents a historical overview of the sugar industry in Turkey,
tracing its development from its origins in the early 20th century to the
present day. They describe the various policy measures that have been
implemented over the years to support the sector, including measures to promote
investment in sugar factories, improve agricultural productivity, and regulate
the market for sugar.</p>

<p>According to Esturk (2018), even though agriculture is a sector that makes
significant contributions to the economy and the capital accumulation process
at the initial stage of economic development, the cost of sugar produced by the
state in Turkey in 2018 is about twice the world average with a ton price of
900 dollars. The reason for this can be shown as the old technology production
structure of public sugar factories with high employees. Despite the
negativities of the sugar industry is in, the added value and social benefits
it creates are high. Sugar beet farming, directly and indirectly, affects
approximately 10 million people in Turkey. The privatization of some of the
state-owned sugar factories in the sugar industry in Turkey and the fact that
the high-tech sugar factories established by the private sector began to
operate, increasing the level of productivity in the sector.</p>

<p>The study conducted by Cimenderoglu and Erenoglu (2021) examines the
socioeconomic effects of sugar factories in Kastamonu, Turkey. One of the key
findings of the study is the significant positive impact of sugar factories on
the local economy, particularly in terms of employment and income generation.
The authors note that the establishment of sugar factories has led to the
creation of a large number of jobs, both directly and indirectly, and has also
contributed to the growth of other industries such as agriculture and
transportation. In addition, the analysis reveals that farmers are producing
far from modern technologies such as soil analysis.</p>

<p>Demir (2017) attributes the inefficiency of sugar production in the region
to the climatic conditions of the region. However, he emphasized that
productivity can be increased with the right policies and investments to be
made in districts where climate conditions are more suitable. He also
underlined the social problems that would be caused by the privatization of the
Kars sugar factory, which was in a state of privatization for a period.</p>

<p>It is necessary to look at the reasons why factories are demanded to be
privatized as well as their impact on society. Unsal (2022) stated in his
report that there are vital issues that need to be resolved for the
sustainability of the sugar industry. While the share of sugar cane in sugar
production was 63% in the 1980s, it is predicted that it will increase to 79% in
2022. Due to its higher cost, domestic sugar has no competitive power with cane
sugar. Additionally, he adds that the use of ethanol as a fuel has made oil and
sugar prices sensitive to each other.</p>

<p>The article (Erdal G. et all, 2007) addresses the importance of sugar beet
production in Turkey and provides an overview of the sugar industry in the
country. The authors then delve into the specific case of the Tokat province,
examining the energy use and economic viability of sugar beet production in the
region. They utilize a range of data sources, including field studies and
surveys, to provide a detailed analysis of the energy inputs and outputs of
sugar beet production in Tokat. This study reveals that due to the wrong
fertilizer use, farmers are both economically damaged and endanger their
environmental health. He also states that since the fields used in production
are small/medium-sized, they use inefficient diesel fuel.</p>

<p>There are also studies on the effects of privatization, such as the article
of Cinar et al. (2020) provide a technical analysis of sugar factories. The
authors found that privatized sugar factories were not efficient, but achieved
a relative productivity increase after privatization. They also state that only
one of the state-owned sugar factories is efficient. They also state that even
though the productivity increase is limited, the technology increase.</p>

<p>Alper Demirdogen (2023) argues that since 1923, the state has been using
sugar factories as a policy tool to increase the social welfare of farmers.
Therefore, farmers have high trust in public sugar factories. With the
privatization move in 2018, there were decreases in production in 13 factories
that were reported to be privatized. Because in this transition period, farmers
preferred to avoid uncertainty and plant other crops.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Times",serif'>Approximately 28% of world sugar production is produced from
sugar beet and 72% from sugar cane. Sugar produced from sugar cane has a lower
cost due to reasons such as the production of sugar cane, which can only be
grown in tropical and sub-tropical regions, at a lower cost compared to sugar
beet, and low processing costs (Kaya, 2015). Due to its costs, sugar beet does
not have the power to compete with sugar cane. In addition, there is no
difference in quality between the sugars that are produced. For these reasons,
the transition from sugar beet production to sugar cane production is
inevitable in the long run.</span></p>

quota system that prevents starch-based sugar from being sold in the country. 3
different quota systems are applied for both beet types, these are A, B and C
quotas. A quota determines the amount of sugar that is planned to be sold
domestically within 1 year. The B quota determines the amount of sugar that can
be found in warehouses longer than 1 year. The C quota determines the amount of
sugar allowed to be sold abroad. For starch-based sugar, the a quota could be
at most 10% of the total a quota. However, this was reduced to 2.5% in 2018. In
other words, 95% of the sugar sold in the country must be sugar produced from
sugar beet.</span></p>

earned 3.452.200.000 TL, which is approximately 506.806,000 € at the euro
exchange rate of that period. The important point here is the commitment of
these factories to continue production for 5 years. The locations where sugar
factories are located in the city are generally locations that have the quality
of valuable land. In other words, companies can stop the production of
factories and use the factory's areas for construction, if they want, from the
end of 2023. Therefore, this can be seen as an opportunity for a gradual
transition to cane sugar production.</span></p>

because of the uncertainty environment created by the privatization movement.

beet production, it has an effect increasing the harvest of the next year,

<p class=MsoEndnoteText><span lang=TR style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times",serif'>Since
the cost of sugar produced from sugar beet is high, it is imperative to switch
to production with sugar cane. The production of sugar cane, which is only
produced in Düzce, needs to be expanded in our country. The privatization of
sugar factories is therefore necessary. However, the prosperity that sugar
factories provide to farmers must continue to be provided in other ways. It is
clear that the sugar produced from sugar beet has no power in export. The
number of exports decreased after the previous export supports were not given
with the IMF stand-by agreement.</span></p>

<p class=MsoEndnoteText><span lang=TR style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times",serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoEndnoteText><span lang=TR style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times",serif'>Since
the 5-year production obligation rule set during the privatization of sugar
factories will expire at the end of 2023, it is inevitable to create a state of
uncertainty. Even though the factories were outside the city at the time they
were built, they almost stayed in the city centers after the cities grew. This
has caused their lands to become valuable for the construction industry.
Therefore, it is inevitable - in the long term - that these factories will be
closed in time to make use of their lands.</span></p>

<p class=MsoEndnoteText><span lang=TR style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times",serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoEndnoteText><span lang=TR style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times",serif'>Farmers
are insecure about producing in privatized factories. It still has not reached
the average production in 2017. In places where there are state factories,
production has returned to its previous levels - even above - after the year of
uncertainty. I emphasized that sugar factories are a political tool to keep
farmers in their villages. The privatization of sugar factories did not change
this.</span></p>
